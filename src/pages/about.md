Hey, future Me. Still alive? Good.

This Time Machine is not just a website—it’s a backup of our brain. Every thought, every feeling, every random thing we wanted to remember is here. We wrote all this because we know one thing for sure—we forget stuff. A lot.

Maybe we were happy when we wrote something, maybe we were sad, or maybe we were just sitting there overthinking life like idiots. But whatever it was, it mattered at that moment. So don’t judge past us, okay? We were just doing our best.

If you ever feel lost, just scroll back. Read what we wrote, relive the moments, and see how we survived all those stupid situations. And no, don’t delete anything. If you don’t like it, just ignore it. We wrote this for us, not for anyone else.

Alright, that’s enough talking. Go do whatever you were supposed to do.
