Hello! I'm Krishna Chaitanya, a passionate and dedicated computer science enthusiast currently in my 4th year of B.Tech. at Sv Colleges, Tirupati. My journey in the world of technology began early, fueled by a deep interest in programming, cybersecurity, and networking. I have completed the prestigious CS50 in Cyber Security from Harvard University, which significantly broadened my understanding of the field.	</p>

<!--[my personal blog](https://krishnablogs.netlify.app).-->

I have a diverse skill set that includes Python programming, networking, and hardware components. My experience extends to working on various projects, including creating a voting website using Flask and HTML, developing a Python program for converting variable names from camel case to snake case, and working on a software tool called 'Snakes Hash Identifier' for identifying different types of encryption hashes.

As a high school sophomore, I was already deeply involved in gaming, which has evolved into a broader interest in technology and security. Iâ€™m also a part of the '100 Days of Code in Python' Udemy course community, where I continue to hone my skills and challenge myself with advanced programming tasks.

## Tech Stack

This theme is written in vanilla JavaScript (+ TypeScript for type checking) and a little bit of ReactJS for some interactions. TailwindCSS is used for styling; and Markdown is used for blog contents.-->

In addition to my academic pursuits, I lead an open-source GitHub organization called 'Snakes n' Networks,' where I work on innovative projects like a Chrome extension for website cloning. My goal is to contribute meaningfully to the tech community by creating tools that help others understand and navigate the complexities of technology and security.


I am always eager to learn more, take on new challenges, and collaborate with like-minded individuals. Whether it's developing software, exploring new tech trends, or diving into cybersecurity, I'm passionate about making an impact in the tech world.
