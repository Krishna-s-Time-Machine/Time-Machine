  She gave me the best gift without even knowing it—she made the impossible happen. Just for a moment, just in a dream, she placed me right beside her. But reality…

It was almost too late. I was running like crazy, trying to reach my classroom before the bell rang. My heart was racing, my breath uneven, but none of it mattered—until I stepped inside.

There she was. Sitting at the last second bench.

Everything else faded. The noise, the people, even their faces—I couldn’t see anything except her. I somehow found a seat, but I couldn’t see her properly. I kept shifting, adjusting, trying every possible angle to catch a glimpse.

Then suddenly—my mom walked into the classroom.

Damn. Is she my class teacher?
Ahh shit. I was cooked.

Before I could process what was happening, she came straight to me. “Take your bag,” she said, and in the next moment, I was sent to the girls’ row. To sit beside her.

Right beside her. Like bench mates.

She started talking, and I… I was just staring at her. Like a crazy fool.

That feeling—it was enough for this life.

I always hated the fact that my mother was a teacher. But this time, she was an angel. She gave me the best gift I could ever receive—she made the impossible happen by making me sit beside her.

But then…

I woke up.

It was a dream.

Or was it? Because deep down, I know something similar happened in my childhood. Maybe not exactly like this, but this moment—this emotion—had been triggered again.

And she was the reason.

She sent a childhood snap yesterday. It was her photo, but that [child—Harshi](https://github.com/ekrishnachaitanya2004/Krishna-Site-Doc/blob/main/27JUL2023/1fc47516-4cd6-4f1a-85bf-73c205d487da.jpeg?raw=true)—belongs to me. I take every part of her childhood as mine. Every memory, every glimpse—I make it mine.

Yet, after waking up, I felt happy.

I do get nightmares sometimes. But it’s different now. My mind isn’t haunted by fear—it’s haunted by her. A name, a face, a moment—and suddenly, she’s there in my thoughts again.

But I can’t make it real.

My mom is not an angel anymore because she is the reason I missed her this much. She was the one who stopped me from joining SRM College, and that decision changed everything.

She’s gone.

I just… missed her.

But the pic she sent—it’s epic. I’m gonna keep it with me for life. When she left for the first time, I searched everywhere for a photo of her. I searched… and searched… tried every possible way. But back then, there was no social media, no way to just scroll and find her.

And honestly, I love those days. The time I spent with her was the only time I was truly happy, truly smiling. Maybe everything I do is for her. Maybe I live for her.

Maybe… I’ll feel the same way again after marriage. 🥰
