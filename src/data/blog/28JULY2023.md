I just controlled myself the whole day, telling myself not to call her. Just don’t do it.

I even went to college, thinking at least that would distract me. But guess what? It was a holiday—Muharram. What the fuck. I didn’t even check my class group. Wasted trip.

So, I returned home by 10 AM. While traveling back, the dream from last night came rushing back, messing with my head again. And suddenly, I felt this urge to call her. Just hear her voice. But then again—she must be in her college. And even if I did call, what would I even talk about? I had nothing to share, no actual reason to call. What’s the point?

My mind kept spinning with thoughts, doubts, overthinking every possibility, every response she might give. Just as usual. I plugged in my earphones, played Dawn FM, and tried to shut it all out.

But even after reaching home, she was still there—stuck in my head, refusing to leave. I looked at her pictures. And I don’t know why, but she felt different. Like a stranger. Like someone who had already moved far, far away from me. Maybe I’m just overthinking, or maybe it’s the truth.

She spends all her time with her new college friends now. Enjoying, laughing, living life. But not even a single call. Not even a thought about me.

I worry. I really do. What if she forgets me completely? What if she never thinks about me again?

And here I am, scared that if I call, she’ll just sigh, Ahh, he’s calling again… Like I’m some nuisance she tolerates.

But sometimes, I wonder—what if, one day, without any message or missed call from me, she calls me first?

If that day ever comes, I swear… I’ll die for her.
