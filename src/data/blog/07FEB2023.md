  You sent me a snap with that songâ€”Locked Away. For a second, I thought it meant something. I listened, I felt it, I overthought it. But in the end, was it even for me?

You sent me a snap with that songâ€”'Locked Away.'

For a moment, I just stared at it. I played the song, listened to every word, and let it sink in. These are the exact questions Iâ€™ve wanted to ask you for years. But now, you sent them to me. So, what do you want me to say? Are you asking me, or are you answering me? I donâ€™t know. But if you need answers, here they are.

If I got locked away and we lost it all today, would you still love me the same?

You know the answer. I have nothing right now. No money, no status, no success. And yet, you are the only thing that ever mattered to me. Even when I had nothing, I held onto you. So if it was the other way aroundâ€”if you lost everything, do you really think my feelings would change? No. Not even for a second.

If I showed you my flaws, if I couldnâ€™t be strong, would you still love me the same?

I have shown you my flaws every single day. You have seen me at my weakest, my most broken moments. I never hid from you, never pretended to be someone Iâ€™m not. And still, I was never enough for you. I have fallen apart so many times, and yet, here I amâ€”standing, waiting, hoping. If roles were reversed, would you have done the same for me?

Would you really ride for me? Would you die for me? Would you spend your whole life with me?

I donâ€™t need you to die for me, and I donâ€™t need you to prove anything. I just wanted you to stay. Thatâ€™s all. Not out of obligation, not out of guiltâ€”just because you wanted to. But did you? Or was I just someone you kept around when it was convenient?

If I didnâ€™t have anything, would you still be there?

I never had anything, and you still left. So tell me, was it ever about me at all? Or just about what I could give you? I never asked for much. I just wanted you. Thatâ€™s it.

Tell me, tell me, would you want me? Tell me, tell me, would you call me?

You could have called me anytime. But you never did. And now, after all this time, you send me this song. What do you want me to say? Do you want me to believe that you finally understand? Or are you just playing with my head again?

If you wanted answers, there they are. But if you wanted me to believe something elseâ€”to believe that you still careâ€”then donâ€™t send me a song. Just tell me. Just say it.

Because Iâ€™ve been waiting for your words for years.

Bro, just realized she probably sent this snap to everyone... I'm a whole clown ðŸ¤¡
