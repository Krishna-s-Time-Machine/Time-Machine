  Signed up for CS50 Cybersecurity out of curiosity, took four months instead of eight weeks, and got the certificate. Was it useful? Maybe. Was it needed? Probably not. Just something to look back on.

I don’t know why I even started this CS50 Cybersecurity course. Maybe just for time pass, maybe just because it was from Harvard, or maybe just because I wanted another certificate to add to my collection. Either way, I enrolled on 28 May 2024 through edX. I had already watched some live sessions before, so answering the questions wasn’t really an issue. Of course, I didn’t want to waste much time, so I made some changes to my answers using GPT and submitted them.

That’s when I noticed something important in the instructions—plagiarism detection. I immediately checked my submission, and turns out only 50% of it was unique. Not wanting to take any risks of getting de-enrolled, I ran it through a humanizing tool, made it up to 80% unique, and then submitted it properly. A day later, I got my first confirmation mail: my assignment had been submitted. Cool. Then, the score came—10/10. I was shocked. But after a moment, I realized it wasn’t the real deal; it was just Assignment 0. Basically, just a test to see if the submission process worked properly.

So, I moved on to Assignment 1. Same process, same tools, no changes. Submitted it and got a score of around 9. Not bad. The course had six assignments in total—five writing assignments and one final project that required a video explanation. I finished all my writing assignments on Mon, 2 Sept 2024. The easiest part was just processing everything through tools, making sure it wasn’t flagged, and submitting it without a second thought.

But the real challenge was the final project. I had to pick a cybersecurity topic, research it, and present my findings in a video. I wanted something recent, something that had real-world impact. That’s when I came across the "Remote Control Vulnerability in Kia Vehicles." It was one of the biggest cybersecurity issues at the time, and it caught my attention immediately. I spent days researching, making notes, and putting everything together. After enough work, I finally completed the project and submitted it on Fri, 1 Nov 2024.

Then came the waiting period. I wasn’t sure if I had done everything correctly, and the course was supposed to be completed in just 8 weeks. But here I was, 4 months in, still unsure if I’d get the certificate or not. The anxiety kicked in. I checked my email every day, waiting for an update, refreshing my inbox like a madman. And then, finally, on Tue, 12 Nov 2024, at around 09:40 AM, the mail arrived. The certificate was generated successfully.

I felt relieved. But at the same time, I knew this wasn’t really a big deal. It was just a time pass. Just another certificate. Still, it was a process, an experience, something to look back on. And that’s why I’m writing this—to remind myself that even when things seem unnecessary, they still become a part of my timeline, a part of my story. I finished CS50 Cybersecurity in 4 months instead of 8 weeks, and in the end, all that mattered was that I did it.
