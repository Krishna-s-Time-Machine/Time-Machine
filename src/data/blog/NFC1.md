   A two-month journey of strength training turned into a frustrating time sink due to unwanted distractions. From gym bros overstaying their welcome to wasted hours, I realized the importance of setting boundaries. Now, it’s time to reset—new plan, new mindset, no more wasted time.

December 30, 2024—I joined NFC through my uncle, Suresh. This wasn’t some regular gym where you just pay a fee and walk in. It’s a private place, and only a few people get in through referrals. The trainer, Jyothiram sir, is a well-experienced guy, and on my first day, he took all my health and body metrics before starting basic strength training. My slot was set—5 PM to 7 PM, training alongside my uncle and Santhi aunty.

  After a few days, I got to know some new gym bros—Raghavendra, Sandeep, Thrinesh, and senior Ravi bro. Things were going smooth. I was seeing changes, feeling good, and sticking to my schedule. But then, my friend Teja showed up.

  Teja kept bugging me about joining NFC. I told him straight up—this gym doesn’t allow outsiders unless referred. But he wouldn’t stop. Every day, it was the same thing—"Bro, ask your trainer," "Bro, give me his number." I wasn’t comfortable bringing him in, but just to shut him up, I called my trainer right in front of him, hoping he’d say no. But no, my bad luck—Jyothiram sir said, "Bring him, I’ll see." Damn.

  So, Teja joins, and just like that, my whole training schedule is ruined. What used to take me two hours is now stretching to three. I start skipping cardio just to keep up. And the worst part? I have to pick him up from home, train with him, and then drop him back. I’m leaving at 4:30 PM and getting home at 7:30 PM, completely drained and irritated.

  Then enters Manoj, another new guy at the gym. At first, it was chill. One day, Teja took a week off for his birthday trip, and I finally had some peace. I was getting my workouts done quickly again. But then Manoj started asking me to check his form. Fine, I helped. After two days, he took my number and started calling me—"When are you coming, bro?"

  Now, he’s 10 years older than me, so out of respect, I responded. But then he started insisting I train in the morning—9 AM to 11 AM—because the gym would be empty. I tried it once, and yeah, the session was smooth. But soon, I realized I was spending 3-4 hours there just because there was no crowd and this guy kept talking between sets. My entire morning was gone.

  Now, fast forward to March 1, 2025. Two months down, I’ve barely completed my first workout cycle. I’ve wasted so much time—thanks to Teja, Manoj, and this unnecessary socializing. And Friends and Family ask me, "Why don’t you interact much? Why do you always stay home?" THIS is why. Unwanted people drain my time and energy.

  I’ve had enough. From March 3, I’m cutting out all distractions, fixing my schedule, and balancing both gym and my own stuff. No more nonsense.

  **New plan, new mindset, no time waste.**

  But the good thing is, I gained weight, reduced my body fat, and kept all my health metrics in check. I stuck to a proper diet with enough protein and carbs as per my needs. These two months were productive in terms of fitness, and I’m satisfied with that. But I completely stopped working on my old projects and didn’t do anything new in tech. I need a perfect schedule now. Everything, from my diet and workout plans to all the files and notes, is stored in my hard disk and some in my repo (attached below). Now, time to balance both worlds!
