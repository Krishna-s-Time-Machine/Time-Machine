  Yesterday, I got terminated from my TOEFL exam, and it left me questioning everything—should I really go for my master’s? Or is something telling me to stay back? I decided to call Harshi, hoping for clarity. But what happens when the one person you seek answers from doesn’t even pick up?

So today, something weird happened. I decided to call Harshi. Yeah, yeah, I know… big deal, right? But listen—this was important!

Yesterday, my TOEFL exam got terminated while I was taking it. Like, boom! Gone! I was so confused. Should I even go for my master’s? Is this a sign that I shouldn’t go? Maybe I should just stay here… with her… I don’t know. My brain was a mess.

And guess what? I thought maybe Harshi could help me figure things out. So, I decided to call her and ask what she thinks. I actually tried calling her on October 29th when I was about to start my master’s process, but she didn’t reply. I still went ahead with it, and well… you know how that turned out. Disaster. Maybe her decision mattered more than I thought.

So today at exactly 7 PM, I picked up my phone and called her.

No answer.

I tried again.

Still nothing.

Again.

NOTHING.

No missed call. No reply. Not even a blue tick. Is she busy?

I don’t know, but I sat there staring at my phone, waiting. And waiting. And waiting…
