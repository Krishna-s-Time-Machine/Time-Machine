  Ever had one of those moments where someone’s actions make zero sense? Yeah, this is one of those days. From random calls to ridiculous requests, to someone thinking they’re the boss of me—this experience was just ugh! Here’s why staying home is sometimes the best choice…

So today, something weird happened. I decided to call Harshi. Yeah, yeah, I know… big deal, right? But listen—this was important!

Yesterday, my TOEFL exam got terminated while I was taking it. Like, boom! Gone! I was so confused. Should I even go for my master’s? Is this a sign that I shouldn’t go? Maybe I should just stay here… with her… I don’t know. My brain was a mess.

And guess what? I thought maybe Harshi could help me figure things out. So, I decided to call her and ask what she thinks. I actually tried calling her on October 29th when I was about to start my master’s process, but she didn’t reply. I still went ahead with it, and well… you know how that turned out. Disaster. Maybe her decision mattered more than I thought.

So today at exactly 7 PM, I picked up my phone and called her.

No answer.

I tried again.

Still nothing.

Again.

NOTHING.

No missed call. No reply. Not even a blue tick. Is she busy?

I don’t know, but I sat there staring at my phone, waiting. And waiting. And waiting…
