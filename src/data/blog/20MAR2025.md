Finally, I Get It…

After waiting for so long, checking my phone again and again, hoping she’d reply… nothing. No messages, no calls, not even a blue tick. At first, I was kinda upset. Why isn’t she responding? What’s going on? Did I do something wrong? My mind was running in circles.

But then… I saw her snaps. And suddenly, it all made sense.

She’s been so busy. Like, REALLY busy.

First, at 11 AM, she was sitting in an office, waiting to join a Google Meet. Not her usual college setup—this looked different. Maybe Accenture? Maybe some training? My brain went full detective mode. What is she up to? 🤔

Then later, at 5:44 PM, another snap. This time, she was in college, watching her friends practice for an event called “Commune 25.” So she spent her whole day in college??

Now, here’s my prediction: She had some kind of test or training in the morning at a new place (maybe Accenture), and after that, she directly went to college instead of going home. That means whatever she’s doing now is close to her college. If it’s Accenture, then it must be the DLF IT Park branch in Chennai—that’s the only one nearby. She must be balancing both—new training and college events.

But wait—the next day at 5:23 PM, another snap, same place, same bench. But now, she was writing a test in a Google Form?? A TEST? In a Google Form? That was kinda funny. Who even does that? 😂

Finally, at 7:25 PM, she was at a metro station, probably heading home after a long day. She wasn’t free even for a second.

And that’s when it hit me.

I know her. I know how she thinks. She must’ve seen my messages. She must be feeling bad for not replying. Maybe she thought, “I’ll text later when I’m free,” but then got too tired or caught up in something else. That’s just how she is.

I get it now. She wasn’t ignoring me. She was just too busy.

And honestly? I’m okay with that. 🙂
