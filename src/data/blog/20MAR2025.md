  Marriage—the so-called "ultimate goal" society pushes on everyone. But is it really for you? Or is it just a lifelong trap disguised as a dream?
---
Tell me—why should I even consider marriage when the one person I truly love is no longer in my life? What’s the point of forcing something that will never feel real? People talk about marriage like it’s just another milestone, like it’s something you do because “that’s how life is.” But is it really? Or is it just another burden, another cycle of responsibilities and sacrifices that never truly end?

For all these years, I lived under the roof my parents built with their sweat and struggles. Every meal, every comfort I had—it wasn’t mine, it was theirs. They worked tirelessly to make sure I had a life they never did, that I didn’t have to go through the same hardships they endured. I’ve seen the sacrifices they made, the way they gave up their own happiness just to secure mine. They spent their entire youth ensuring that my brother and I never felt the weight of the world too soon. And now, when it’s finally my turn, should I just turn my back on them and build another family while they grow old waiting for the same love they once gave me? No. I can’t. I won’t.

Marriage? It’s just a cycle—one that forces you into a system where you work not for yourself, not for your dreams, but just to keep a family afloat. You wake up every morning, not because you want to, but because you have to. Your entire existence becomes about earning, saving, providing, and sacrificing. But what about me? My dreams? My happiness?

If I get married, I don’t just gain a wife—I gain lifelong responsibilities. A house to run, a family to provide for, a future to secure—not just for me, but for my wife and kids. Every decision I make, every step I take will no longer be about what I want, but what they need. And if I fail? If I don’t earn enough? Then I watch them suffer. I’ve seen this happen to people around me. Marriages that started with love but ended in stress, compromise, and regrets. I refuse to be that person.

People say, “Now women work too. Life won’t be as hard.” But that’s not how I see it. If I marry someone, she’s my responsibility. If I married Harshi, why should she have to work? She’s a queen. She deserves a life where she doesn’t have to worry about anything. She should be able to wake up and live freely, without stress, without burdens. If I can’t give her that, then why should I drag her into my life just to struggle together? She can live on her own, independent, without me pulling her down into this mess.

I love her. I always will. But love isn’t just about being together—it’s about knowing when to let go. And if letting go means she gets to live a better life, then so be it.

If she isn’t in my life, then no one else is stepping in. I can live without her, but I won’t replace her. Some people move on, find someone new, build another story. That’s not me. If it’s not her, it’s no one.

So tell me again—why should I marry? Just to continue this endless cycle? To sacrifice my life for someone I barely know, just because society expects it? No.

If marriage isn’t with Harshi, then it’s not happening. That’s it. No debate. No further discussion.
