APS Application Done!

Yesterday Morning at 11:40 AM, I made my APS account and filled in all my details carefully. I checked everything twice to make sure it was correct. After that, I saved all the emails, payments, and documents, just in case I needed them later.

I talked to Nitheesh, and he told me that my account would be activated in 24 hours, so I had to wait before making the payment.

Today at 12 PM, I got an email saying my account was activated! So, I quickly logged in and paid ₹18,000 for the application fee.

Next, I had to send my hard copies to APS India in Delhi. I called Nitheesh, and we went to iXerox to take colored copies of all my documents. We arranged them properly as per the APS checklist, packed them nicely, and then went to a Professional Courier Service to send them.

Now, I just have to wait! It might take 60 days, so hopefully, it will be done by May.

Since everything is confirmed now, I have to start preparing for IELTS again! No second thoughts, no hesitation—this time.
