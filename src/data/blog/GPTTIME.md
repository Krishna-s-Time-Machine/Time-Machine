Dear Future Me,

Guess what? I just found out that ChatGPT 3.5 was officially released to the public on March 15, 2023! And you know whatâ€™s funny? Iâ€™ve been using it to turn all my messy, raw thoughts into classy blogs. But waitâ€”thereâ€™s more to the story!

You see, I have all these old writings, and theyâ€™re full of feelings. Some are weird, some are deep, and some just donâ€™t make sense. But I love them because they are *real*. They capture my thoughts exactly how they were in the moment. Still, sometimes, when I read them, I feel like my words donâ€™t look the way I imagined them in my head. Ever had that feeling? Itâ€™s super annoying!

So, I got an ideaâ€”I fed my old blogs and random writing scraps into ChatGPT and gave it a simple job: "Just fix my grammar but keep my raw emotions." And boom! The result was crazy. My thoughts were still *my thoughts*, just smoother, like someone had gently brushed the wrinkles out of my words. It felt magical, like looking into a mirror that shows exactly how you remember yourself.

After seeing this, I made up my mind: I *have* to update all my old blogs. Not to change what I felt, but to make them *perfectly me*. The real me, but clearer. So, I started converting them one by oneâ€¦ and then I hit a limit. Turns out, ChatGPT only lets me process so many PDFs per day. That was frustrating because I just wanted to get everything done *right now*!

But guess what I did? (Future me, donâ€™t judge!) I kindaâ€¦ spammed ChatGPT with multiple accounts just so I could get all my blogs fixed in one day. Yeah, I know, not my proudest moment, but hey, I had a mission! And in the end, I got what I wantedâ€”every old blog, refreshed but still carrying that raw feeling.

So, Future Me, if you ever feel like your writing isnâ€™t quite *you*, just remember this: the thoughts are always yours. Sometimes, they just need a little polish to shine exactly the way you see them in your head. And if AI can help with that, why not use it?

See you in the future!

â€”Past Me
