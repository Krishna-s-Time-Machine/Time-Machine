  Ever had one of those moments where someone’s actions make zero sense? Yeah, this is one of those days. From random calls to ridiculous requests, to someone thinking they’re the boss of me—this experience was just ugh! Here’s why staying home is sometimes the best choice…

Okay, so today was just… UGH! I swear, this is why I hate dealing with certain people. They just don’t make sense! It’s like they have two brains, but neither of them is in their head. Let me tell you what happened.

I was just lying in bed, watching some random YouTube video about Solana tokens, Then suddenly, CV called me. At first, I ignored it. Then he messaged me, asking me to call him. So, fine, I called.

He told me, "Aray, Bindhu ki call chey."

I was like, "Why?"

Then he explained the whole mess. Apparently, last week in the lab, that MF Sonteesh told the class to create a group email for all our classmates (apart from the official college emails). He asked for volunteers, and some people with nothing better to do raised their hands. So, he assigned it to them. Now, since I only go to college for labs, I didn’t even know about this.

I asked CV, "What should I do now?" And he just kept insisting that I call her. But WHY should I call her? It’s her job to collect details. If it’s important, she should be calling me, not the other way around!

Honestly, I have no issue making a call if it’s necessary. But here’s the problem—she collected everyone’s numbers, but she expects us to call her and do her work. That makes no sense!

Now, let me tell you why this was even more annoying. She literally has zero knowledge about computers. Like, I had a crazy experience with her once. I don’t remember exactly when, but one day in the lab, I was sitting next to her. She was struggling with turning on her system for 30 whole minutes! Then she asked me for help. I told her to swap places with me. The moment I sat down, I checked the cables, and guess what? She never even turned on the switch! Like, seriously?! That day, I realized—some people just come to study CS without even knowing the basics.

Anyway, back to today’s story. CV kept insisting I call her. But nope, not happening. If she needs something, she can call me. So, I told CV, "Why are you so interested in this?" and hung up.

Then he called me again! He said, "Do this for me, bro." And since he’s my school friend and sticks with me in college, I finally gave in. I just messaged her "Hlo."

And boom! Instant reply! No delay at all.

She said, "HI....61......Aa....Rolno..."

I said, "Yes."

Then she just replied, "Ok ra."

Wait, what? She called me "ra"?!

Even my close friends only call me "EK" or "Chaithu," but she calls me "ra" like I’m her servant?! No common sense at all! Literates, but no basic manners. That just made my blood boil. I don’t even know how I reacted at that moment. But this—this is why I avoid college. I don’t want to deal with this nonsense in real life. Staying home is so much safer!

Honestly, moments like these just make me hate dealing with these kinds of people even more...
