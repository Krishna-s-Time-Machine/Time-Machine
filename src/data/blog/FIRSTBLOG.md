At first, I didn't even think of making a blog. I just wrote everything down in plain text documents—random thoughts, memories, and things I wanted to remember. It was just my way of keeping track of life, like a little time capsule. But then, I realized something—I needed a better place to store all this. Somewhere safe. Somewhere hidden.

That’s when I found GitHub.

At first, it felt weird—who even uses GitHub for something like this? But it was perfect. A place where I could stash all my memories, organized, backed up, and most importantly—completely under my control. And the best part? My mom would never find it. She has a way of knowing every tiny thing I do, like she has some superhuman sixth sense for tracking me. But this time? No chance. I bet she’ll never figure this one out. 

So, my simple text files slowly turned into something more. I started treating it like a personal time machine—a place where I could revisit my thoughts from any point in time. And eventually, I thought, why not turn it into a blog? A proper space where I could write everything, not just for storage, but to read back one day and relive every stupid, funny, and emotional moment I ever had.

And that’s how this whole thing started. A bunch of random text files turned into a personal archive, hidden away in GitHub, evolving into a blog where I document my life. Now, every time I write something, I know future me will come back and read it. Maybe to laugh, maybe to cringe, or maybe to remember things exactly as they were.

But one thing’s for sure—this is my space, my time machine, and no one, especially not my mom, is gonna find it.
