  Just like last year, I’m playing the same little game—changing my birthday, turning off social media, and waiting. Will she remember? Or was it always just a reminder notification? This time, I’ll find out.

Only one week left for my 21st birthday! And guess what? I’m doing the same thing I did last year—reading my old post to see what happened. Feels funny because I already know everything, but still, I’m here hoping something different will happen this time.

This year, I really, really want her to wish me. I’ve been trying so hard—calling, sending snaps, making sure she sees my name pop up every now and then. Every time she sends a snap, I save it immediately, so she’ll see my name in her notifications. Maybe that will remind her. Maybe she’ll think of me, even for a second.

Like last time, I turned off everything—no Instagram, no WhatsApp stories, no reminders for anyone. But Snapchat? No way, I’m keeping that! That’s the only place she’s active. If she wishes me anywhere, it’s going to be there.

And yeah… I’m changing my birthday again. From March 2nd to March 3rd. Just to see if she actually remembers or if she just wishes me because of a notification. If she falls for it again, then I’ll know she never really remembered.

Maybe she’s thinking, “Should I text him? After ignoring him for so long, will it be weird?” Maybe she just doesn’t care at all.

I don’t know what’s gonna happen. Maybe nothing. Maybe everything. But if she does end up wishing me on March 2nd, even by accident, I’ll be happy. Let’s see how this goes…
