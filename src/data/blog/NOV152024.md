  Got an email saying my TOEFL scores were canceled because they think I cheated—what?! Now I’m banned for a year! Called Dhamodhar, he said don’t worry

Okay, so today was really bad. Like, really, really bad. I woke up and checked my email, and guess what? TOEFL people sent me a message saying my scores are gone because they think I cheated. CHEATED?! ME?! What are they even talking about?! 😭

And it gets worse. They said I can’t take any ETS exams until November next year! A WHOLE YEAR! I just sat there staring at the screen like… what just happened?!

So the first thing I did? I called Dhamodhar Reddy. And you know what he said? “Don’t worry, bro.” LIKE, HELLO?? HOW CAN I NOT WORRY?! 😡 He just told me to take the Duolingo test instead. Like it’s some kind of easy fix. But I didn’t even listen to him. I was already freaking out.

Then I called Umesh. And oh my god… he was so disappointed. He didn’t even yell or anything. He just sounded like he gave up on me. And that? That felt worse than being banned.

Then I had to tell my parents. BUT WAIT—do you think I told them I got banned? NO WAY. I just said, “The exam didn’t go well. I’ll try again in January, maybe IELTS this time.” And they were like, “Okay, do whatever you want.” Phew. Crisis avoided.

But now, the thing that’s really making me go crazy?? She still hasn’t replied. No text. No missed call. NOTHING. I keep thinking, “Did I do something wrong? Why is she ignoring me?” I just wanted to hear her thoughts… but I guess she doesn’t care. 😞
