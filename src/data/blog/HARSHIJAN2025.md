  A sudden call from her after so long—my heart raced. Was it about us? Or something else entirely? What she said left me speechless.

December 31, 2024, started with a small disaster—my [iPod](../IPod/) stopped working. I spent the whole day trying to fix it because I really wanted it to work before the new year. While doing that, I sent a snap to H, pretending I lost my iPod and was letting everyone know. But actually, I only sent it to her.

After hours of trying, I finally got my iPod working again, but all my photos were gone. I tried recovering them from Google Drive, IceDrive, my old phone, and the hidden album, but I could only get back a few. More than 70% of my photos and memories were lost. I backed up whatever I could onto my encrypted hard disk, KHC, with the password saved in DRIVE (just the name without caps). While doing all this, I sent another snap to H.

Later that day, I was at NFC when I got a Snapchat text from H at 4:45 PM: "rey." I froze for a second. I was outside, so I waited until 9:18 PM to reply with just "?" to see what was up. Then I checked WhatsApp and saw a missed call from her, which was unexpected. At 10:10 PM, she messaged again: "Call karo tomorrow." I was really surprised.

The next morning, I called her at 10 AM sharp, but she didn’t pick up. The whole day, I kept thinking about why she wanted to talk. I went through everything I had done recently and thought maybe it was about the iPod snap, which had her name in a synced album title. Was she calling to ask about that? My mind kept coming up with all kinds of reasons.

Later, while I was still at NFC, she called again, but I missed it. Since I had hidden WhatsApp notifications, I didn’t even realize she had called. When I got home, I tried calling her back a few times, but she didn’t answer. I started overthinking—was she going to end our connection? Was it something serious? I was getting mentally ready for the worst.

At 12:00 PM, I messaged her: "Are you busy?" hoping she’d reply during lunch. She said, "CLg lo una da, evng cheysta." I just replied, "Okay."

At 7 PM, she called again. This time, I saw it and said, "I’ll call you at 8 PM." But while locking my phone, I accidentally called her. She picked up but couldn’t hear anything and hung up. Then she texted, "viniptle." I told her it was a mistake and that I’d call her after I got home. She just said, "Sare ra."

At 7:40 PM, I reached home and called her at 8 PM as promised, but she didn’t pick up. After 10 minutes, she called back, but the call rang only once. Then she texted, saying she would call the next day because she had a cold.

The next day, I texted her at lunch: "Are you in college?" She said, "Yes." Then, finally, she told me why she had called. She asked if I wanted to join an internship for a startup they had started. She explained the program, training, benefits, and certification.

At that moment, I felt a huge relief. I had been overthinking so much, expecting some kind of serious talk about us, but in the end, it was just about an internship.

Even though I knew the internship was a scam, I still joined—just for her. Everything I do, even the small things, has always been for her. But the most important thing for me wasn’t the internship; it was the fact that, at that moment, she remembered me. And that was enough to make me happy.
