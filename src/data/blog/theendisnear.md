Thank you, Weeknd. For everything. For every song, every emotion, every moment you gave us.

I still can't believe this is happening. How do you just end something that defined an entire generation? The Weeknd wasn’t just an artist. He was a whole experience, a world we all lived in, a soundtrack to our best and worst days. And now, he's saying goodbye? Feels like the earth just collapsed, and underneath, I'm falling into a dream world where his music never stops, where ‘Die for You' still echoes through the night, where ‘After Hours’ still feels like it dropped yesterday.

Every song reminds me of a moment I lived, like a time machine to the past. The first time I heard ‘House of Balloons,’ I didn’t just listen—I felt it. The darkness, the pain, the raw honesty—it was like stepping into another universe. And with every album after that, he gave us pieces of himself, turning our emotions into melodies. ‘Starboy’ was confidence, ‘Dawn FM’ was acceptance, ‘My Dear Melancholy’ was heartbreak in its purest form.

Abel’s journey, from a kid in Scarborough to the biggest artist in the world, wasn’t just inspiring—it was personal. It was proof that someone could take all the pain, all the loneliness, and turn it into something beautiful. His music wasn’t just beats and lyrics; it was pain, love, chaos, addiction, self-destruction, and redemption—all wrapped in melodies that hit straight to the soul.

And now, he’s ready to move on. Abel Tesfaye doesn’t need The Weeknd to survive anymore. I get it. But man, how do WE move on? His music was there for us through heartbreaks, late-night drives, and moments when life didn’t make sense. It gave us comfort, a place to belong. And now, it’s just… over?

But maybe that’s the thing about legends—they never truly leave. The Weeknd might be ending, but his music, his impact, his legacy—that will live forever. We’ll still be here, playing ‘Call Out My Name’ on repeat, lost in the world he created, remembering every lyric that once felt like it was written just for us.

So, thank you, Abel. For the music, for the memories, for everything. No matter what, The Weeknd will always be with us.

And we’ll keep listening.
