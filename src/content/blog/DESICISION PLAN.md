I need to prepare myself for whatever happens next. If she calls or messages, what should I do? I can’t just sit and wait without a plan. This time, I need to be ready, whether her response is positive or negative. If she calls, I will stick to her words. If she doesn’t, or if she replies with something vague like "It’s your life, your choice," then I know exactly what to do.

First, let’s say she gives a positive response. If she genuinely shows interest in my life and suggests that I stay back, get a job, and build something here, then I will. I have no second thoughts. If she tells me to wait, to settle first, or gives me any direction that shows she cares about my future, I will listen. She has always been the decision-maker in my life when it comes to these things—like when I chose my college in the past. If she really wants me to stay, I’ll do it. I’ll take a job, whether through referrals, drives, or even a backdoor suggestion by Umesh Sota. Whatever it takes.

But if the response is negative—if she doesn’t call, or calls without any real interest, or just says, "It’s your life, do whatever you want"—then I know where I stand. That means she doesn’t care enough to be involved in my decisions. That’s my sign to move on, and I won’t wait any longer. I’ll immediately start preparing for IELTS and make sure to write the exam before April 15. The first step will be to apply for APS immediately. Once the APS and TOEFL applications are paid for, there’s no turning back. That locks me into my decision, forcing me to move forward without looking back.

My dad has been pushing me to finalize this decision, and he’s right. I should have written IELTS in January 2025 itself, but I waited for her response. This time, I won’t. No matter what happens, I will take control of my life and make the right choice for myself.

I will attach both schedules—one for if she gives me a reason to stay and one for if she doesn’t. No more waiting. No more hoping. Just action, based on reality.
