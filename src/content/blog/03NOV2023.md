  Bro, I thought something was wrong. I skipped college, waited all day, worried like crazy… and she? She was just chilling with her friends. Why did she even text me? Why does she keep doing this?

She texted me yesterday. Out of nowhere. Just a simple message. And I don’t know what to do.

The second I saw it, my mind went blank. Is she expecting me to call? Is she just being polite? Or is it just another random message with no meaning? My brain started running in circles. I couldn’t think straight. So, I waited.

I woke up today, determined to call her. But it was too early. What if she was asleep? What if she was busy? I told myself to wait. Just a little longer. Just a few more hours. So, I skipped college. Sat there. Thinking. Overthinking. What if something’s wrong? What if she actually needs to talk? But she never shares anything like that with me. She never tells me when she’s sad. So maybe I’m just making things up in my head again.

At 9 AM, I picked up my phone. My fingers hovered over the call button. Then I stopped. What if she’s in college? She won’t pick up. She’ll see my call and ignore it. Maybe I should wait. Maybe I should call later.

So, I waited again.

6 PM. Sharp. That’s when I called. No more waiting. No more excuses. If she messaged me, she must have something to say, right?

Wrong.

She didn’t pick up.

The phone rang. And rang. And rang. Then silence.

I stared at my screen, my chest heavy. What the hell? What was the point of messaging me if she was just going to ignore me? What changed? Why now? My mind started spinning, trying to piece together something that made sense. Maybe she’s busy. Maybe she didn’t see it. Maybe she’ll call back.

But then.

7:55 PM. *Ping.* A Snapchat notification.

I opened it.

A snap. Just a casual snap. Chilling with her friends. Laughing. Happy. Like nothing happened. Like I didn’t just spend my entire day waiting. Like my missed calls didn’t even exist.

First, I felt relief. She’s okay. There’s no trouble. Nothing’s wrong. That’s good, right?

But then, the real sadness hit.

She saw my call. She saw my message. And she ignored it.

Not even a simple text saying, “Hey, I’m busy.” Not even a fake excuse. Nothing. Just silence. And then a snap. Like I don’t exist. Like I don’t matter.

I spent the whole day thinking about her. Wondering what she wanted to say. Skipping college. Overthinking every possible reason why she messaged me. And she? She just sent a snap and moved on.

Every time she makes a move, it pulls me deeper into this mess. And I let it happen. Over and over again. But no more.

I don’t care anymore.

But I love her.

If she calls, I’ll think about it. If not… I’ll just keep waiting. Forever.
