  She finally messaged me! After all this time, out of nowhere—Hlo. Just three letters, but now my brain is spinning in circles. Does she wanna talk? Should I call? Or is it just a random check-in? I don’t know what to do, so here I am, overthinking like always…

Today, I was just chilling, playing Minecraft like any other normal day. Building, mining, doing my thing, and just when I was about to close the server at exactly 8:17 PM, boom—a popup. A message. And not just any message—it was from her. Harshi.

For a second, I thought I was dreaming. I stared at the screen, trying to process it. After all this time, she made the first move? Finally? But of course, as expected, it was just a "Hlo." That’s it. Just three letters. H-L-O.

Now, what is that even supposed to mean? Is this an invitation to talk? A simple check-in to see if I’m still alive? Or just some random curiosity that popped into her head? My mind went crazy analyzing it. Should I call her? Should I wait? Should I act like I didn’t see it?

I took a deep breath and replied, "Hello, Harshi." Simple. Casual. Normal. As soon as I hit send, I saw that she was online. My heart started racing. Was she really here to talk?

Then she replied, "Em cheystunav ra?" (What are you doing?)

Okay, good. She wants to continue. I told her, "Game adutunna" (Playing a game). And then… she hit me with the classic "Em le ra" (Nothing much).

What does that even mean? Is she hinting me to continue the conversation? Is she waiting for me to call? Or is she just being polite before disappearing for another few months? My brain started running in loops.

I decided to test the waters and asked, "Exams jarugutunaya?" (Are your exams going on?)

And then… silence. The message remained unseen. No reply. Nothing.

Now, here’s the dilemma. If I call her now without her replying, will she think I’m being too eager? Like, "Oh no, I just sent one message, and now he’s calling me again? Here we go." I didn’t want her to feel annoyed. But what if she was feeling low and wanted me to call? What if she actually needed someone to talk to but didn’t want to ask directly?

I just sat there, staring at my screen, waiting, overthinking every possible scenario. Should I call or should I wait? Maybe she’s just busy. Maybe she’ll reply later. Maybe I’m just fooling myself again.

Let’s see how this plays out. But one thing is clear—this one small "Hlo" just turned my whole night upside down.

I just waited, kept checking my phone, and ended up writing this blog. It's 11:30 PM now—maybe she’s asleep, or maybe she just doesn’t want to reply.
