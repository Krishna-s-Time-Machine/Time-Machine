  A sudden call from her after so long—my heart raced. Was it about us? Or something else entirely? What she said left me speechless.

December 31, 2024, started with an unexpected disaster—my iPod stopped working. I spent the entire day trying to restore it, determined to get it fixed before the new year. In the process, I sent a snap to H, pretending I had lost my iPod and was sending it to everyone, but in reality, I only sent it to her.

After hours of effort, [I finally restored my iPod](../IPod/), but all my photos were gone. I tried to retrieve them, managing to recover only a small portion from Google Drive, IceDrive, my old phone, and the hidden album. More than 70% of my photos and memories had vanished. I backed up whatever I could onto my encrypted hard disk, KHC, with the password stored in DRIVE (hint: just the name without caps). While doing this, I sent another snap to H.

Later that day, while I was at NFC, I got a shocking Snapchat text from H at 4:45 PM: “rey.” I froze for a second. Since I was outside, I waited until 9:18 PM to reply with a simple ”?” to gauge her mood. When I checked WhatsApp, I saw a missed call from her—something I never expected. At 10:10 PM, she messaged again: “Call karo tomorrow.” I was speechless.

The next morning, I waited eagerly and called her at 10 AM sharp, but she didn’t pick up. The entire day, I kept wondering why she wanted to talk. I went over everything I had done recently and suspected it was because I had sent her the iPod restoration snap, which had her name in the synced album title. Was she calling to confirm something? My mind raced with endless possibilities.

Later, while I was still at NFC, she called again, but I missed it. Since her WhatsApp notifications were hidden on my phone, I didn’t even realize she had called. When I got home, I tried calling her back multiple times through different methods, but she didn’t answer. I started overthinking—was she going to end our connection? Was this about us? I mentally prepared for the worst.

At exactly 12:00 PM, I messaged her: “Are you busy?” hoping she’d reply during her lunch break. She responded: “CLg lo una da, evng cheysta”. I replied, “Okay.”

At 7 PM, she called again. This time, I saw the call and replied, “I’ll call you at 8 PM.” But while locking my phone, I accidentally called her. She picked up but couldn’t hear anything and hung up. Then, she texted “viniptle”. I explained it was a mistake and told her I’d call her after I got home. She replied, “Sare ra.”

At 7:40 PM, I reached home and called her at 8 PM as promised, but she didn’t pick up. After 10 minutes, she called me back, but it rang only once. She then texted that she would call the next day because she had a cold.

The following day, I messaged her at lunch: “Are you in college?” She replied, “Yes.” Then, finally, she told me the reason she had called. She asked if I wanted to join an internship for a startup they had started. She explained the details of the program, training, benefits, and certification.

At that moment, I felt a huge wave of relief. I had spent all this time overthinking, preparing for a conversation about our relationship, expecting some kind of closure or explanation from her. But in reality, she had just called for something else entirely.

Even though I knew this internship was a scam, I still joined—just for her. Everything I do, every small thing, has always been just for her. But what mattered most to me wasn’t the internship; it was the fact that, in this situation, she remembered me. And for that, I was happy.
