  Just like last year, I’m playing the same little game—changing my birthday, turning off social media, and waiting. Will she remember? Or was it always just a reminder notification? This time, I’ll find out.

No, she just made me feel terrible. Yesterday was my birthday, and she didn’t even wish me. Not a call, not a message, nothing. I waited the whole day, checking my phone every few minutes like a fool, hoping to see her name pop up. But nothing happened.

And then today... she finally sent a message. March 3rd, at 12:50 AM. A simple birthday wish. But by then, it was too late. Too late for it to mean anything. I saw it when I woke up at 6 AM, and honestly, I didn’t even feel anything anymore. Just disappointment. It was like she had fallen straight into my little test. I changed my birthday just to see who actually remembered without a reminder, and she failed.

But what really got me was something else. On Saturday, March 1st, she messaged me at 11:30 PM. Just a casual “hloo.” At that moment, I thought, “Okay, maybe she remembers, maybe she’s about to wish me.” But no. Nothing came after that. She just left it at that, and the next day passed without a word.

So in the end, she did wish me—but only because she saw a notification on Snapchat. Just like everyone else. Just like it was nothing special. That’s what hurt the most. After all these years, after everything, I was just another name on her screen.

I didn’t even know what to reply. I just sent a simple 🙏. Nothing more. Nothing less. What was there left to say?

All these years, I’ve thought about her, watched her, tried to understand her. And here she is, making me feel like the biggest idiot in the world. Like I was the only one who ever cared. Maybe I was. And maybe that’s the saddest part of all.
