## Introduction
I am currently exploring PyTorch, a powerful deep learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. My goal is to gain a solid understanding of its capabilities, build machine learning models, and eventually contribute to real-world AI projects.

## Learning Goals
- Understand the basics of PyTorch, including tensors, autograd, and neural networks.
- Implement basic machine learning algorithms from scratch.
- Explore and use pre-trained models for various tasks.
- Gain hands-on experience with PyTorchâ€™s neural network modules.
- Experiment with custom models for specific tasks, including handwriting recognition.

## Projects
- **Image to Text Converter:** A Flask application that converts images to text. I'm working on integrating a custom model trained in PyTorch to recognize handwritten text.

## Resources
- [Official PyTorch Documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html)
- [Deep Learning with PyTorch: A 60 Minute Blitz](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html)
- [CS50P](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2024/) - For foundational knowledge.

## Future Plans
- **Advanced Model Training:** Delve deeper into training custom models with larger datasets.
- **PyTorch Lightning:** Explore this high-level wrapper to streamline the training process.
- **Contribution:** Contribute to open-source PyTorch projects and share my work with the community.
