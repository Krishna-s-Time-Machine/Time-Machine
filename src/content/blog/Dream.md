  The Dream That Keeps Coming Back

**The Dream That Keeps Coming Back**

I don’t know when it started, but this dream—this same dream—keeps finding me. It sneaks in silently, like a forgotten memory that suddenly starts playing in the back of my mind. And every time, it feels too real, too familiar, like a place I once lived but somehow lost along the way.

The dream always starts the same way. A soft, golden light. It seeps through the 卐-shaped patterned window, cutting through the still air of the classroom, casting lazy shadows on the old wooden desks. The air smells of chalk dust and sun-warmed books. A fan hums in the background, slow and tired, stirring the air just enough to remind me that time is still moving. I sit there, lost in the glow of the evening light, half my face bathed in warmth, the other half in shadow.

And then I see her.

She’s sitting right beside me, just like she always did. The same neatly pressed uniform, the same strands of hair tucked behind her ear, the same quiet presence that always made everything feel right. She turns to me, and for a fleeting moment, our eyes meet. A small, effortless smile spreads across her face—like she knows something I don’t, like she’s happy to see me, like nothing has changed.

I try to speak. I try to move, to reach out, to tell her something—anything. But nothing happens. I have no voice, no hands, no body. It’s like I don’t exist—like I’m just a camera floating in space, watching, observing, feeling everything but unable to do anything. I scream inside my head, but there’s only silence. The only thing that’s real is her, sitting there, looking at me, smiling.

And then, just like that, she’s gone.

She stands up. Slowly, gracefully, like the whole world is waiting for her to move. My heart starts pounding, but I can’t stop her. She takes a step towards the door.And then—

Flicker.

The scene jumps. She’s outside, standing on the school ground, looking back at me. The evening sun paints everything in orange and gold. I try to follow, but—

Flicker.

Now she’s on the road, walking towards her house. The streetlights flicker on one by one, the sky turning darker.

Flicker.

She’s at her house, standing at the gate, her hands Holding on the old iron gates. She turns her head slightly, almost as if she knows I’m there.

Before I know it, I’m standing outside her house. I don’t know how I got here, but it doesn’t matter. I just wait. Just stand there, waiting, hoping to see her again. The sky slowly darkens, the evening sun bleeding into a deep purple, the warmth fading from the air. The street is empty. The Temple closes .The world is quiet. And still, I wait.

Then, suddenly—

I wake up.

The same feeling, the same ache in my chest. The dream keeps coming back, over and over again. And every time, it reminds me of something I can’t quite hold onto.

Maybe some memories refuse to fade. Maybe some people never really leave. Maybe, just maybe, some dreams are meant to stay forever.

All this is like a game. I just start at the same place, like a respawn after losing again and again. Maybe things need to change for me to enter another level.

But should I stop here? Should I finally figure out where she is going? I’ve tried—every time, I think so. But I have no body to hold, no voice to call out. I can just see her. That’s all.

Even now, after all these years, I see her. I see her in pictures, in time that don’t belong to me anymore. But the dream never changes.

No matter how much she has changed, the dream still holds on to the childhood Harshi—the girl who sat beside me, the girl who smiled under that golden evening light. It refuses to let her grow up. It refuses to let me move forward.

Maybe that’s the cruelest part. Reality moving on, but the dream 

Just Going Back in Time...
